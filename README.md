# E-commerce Shipping Analysis

A Power BI dashboard analyzing 10,999 e-commerce orders for delivery performance, revenue, and customer satisfaction.

## Overview
Developed during my Unified Mentor internship, this project uses Power BI, SQL, and Excel on `Ecommerce_Shipping_Data.csv` (columns: `Warehouse_block`, `Mode_of_Shipment`, `Customer_care_calls`, `Customer_rating`, `Reached.on.Time_Y.N`).

## Visuals
- **KPI Cards**: On-Time Delivery Rate (~59.67%), Avg Customer Rating (~3.3/5).
- **Bar Chart**: On-Time Delivery by Mode (Flight: ~65%, Ship: ~50%).
- **Pie Chart**: Revenue by Warehouse (F leads).
- **Scatter Chart**: Weight vs. Customer Care Calls.



## Key Findings
- Flight outperforms Ship in on-time delivery.
- Heavier products (>5000g) slightly increase customer care calls.
- Warehouse F drives the most revenue.

## Tools
- **Power BI**: Visuals, DAX measures.
- **SQL**: Data cleaning (see `data_cleaning.sql`).
- **Excel**: Exploration.

## Files
- `Ecommerce_Shipping_Data.csv`: Dataset (10,999 rows).
- `dashboard_screenshot.png`: Dashboard visual.
- `Ecommerce_Shipping_Analysis.pdf`: Dashboard export.
- `data_cleaning.sql`: SQL queries.
- `dax_measures.txt`: DAX measures.

## How to Run
1. Download `Ecommerce_Shipping_Data.csv` and `Ecommerce_Shipping_Analysis.pbix` (or view PDF).
2. Open in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use slicers for `Mode_of_Shipment`, `Warehouse_block`, etc.
